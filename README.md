# Sea Level Slider

Interactive map of the world with a slider to adjust a simulated sea level.

Does not include effects such as:

* Isostatic rebound
* Terrain changes due to a varying sea level, e.g. sediment filling of basins, erosion. 

Note if all ice caps melted, the ocean would only rise by 70m. Waterworld had it wrong...
